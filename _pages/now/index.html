<p>New Once Worn takes unwanted clothes and fabrics and transforms them into new garments and accessories.  A shirt can become a tunic or cushion cover whilst trousers can be used to create new skirts and kindle covers.  There are so many possibilities with upcycling and Jo loves to be creative with whatever fabric is available. Keen to produce as little waste as possible, Jo endeavours to find ways to use the scraps of fabrics that would usually be thrown away.  One example is making covered buttons and brooches out of beautiful silk scraps.
