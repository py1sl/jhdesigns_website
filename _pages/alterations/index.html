<h2>Dressmaking</h2>
<p>Jo strives for a beautiful, high quality finish in all the clothes she makes.  Jo can make clothes using original designs, commercial patterns or can adapt the commercial pattern to your own specification.  
Perhaps youâ€™ve got an item of clothing that you absolutely love but would like in another colour of fabric?  Jo can create a pattern from that outfit and recreate it for you.
Or, do you have a garment that you love the fabric of but the style no longer suits?  Jo can re-style the garment or create something new from the fabric.
</p><br><p>
All items are handmade by Jo from her sewing room in Duns Tew.

<h2>Alterations</h2>
<p>Sometimes it can be impossible to get a perfect fit from clothes in the shops.  Other times we all change shape and the clothes that used to fit us beautifully no longer sit well on us.  Jo provides an alteration and repair service to help us get the most out of our clothes.
