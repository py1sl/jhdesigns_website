<p>Every wedding dress should be unique to the bride who wears it.  More brides are now wanting their wedding to be sustainable and the dress is a very big part of that.  Jo works with the bride to create a dress that perfectly encapsulates all that is important to them and makes them feel wonderful on the day (and afterwards if the design allows for the dress to be adapted and worn again!).  Jo has recently created two sustainable wedding dresses which had very different briefs: 

<ul>
<li>Carolyn – eco dress for festival wedding </li>
<li>Joanna – 1930s glamour and conversion to post-wedding wear</li>
</ul>
