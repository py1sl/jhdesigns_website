<h2>About</h2>
<p>Jo started her love of sewing and creativity as a child, learning to sew with her Mum.  Ever since that day she has been fascinated with the magical process of taking a piece of folded up fabric and then cutting and sewing it into something totally new.

<p>
Having spent her childhood on a self-sufficient small holding, values of sustainability were important from an early age.  This has manifested itself in Joâ€™s belief that clothing should be more than something we wear for a short time and then discard.  Creating high-quality garments which are durable, stylish and makes the wearer feel fabulous is key.  Jo also experiments with using recycled fabrics and in designing clothes which have more than one way they can be worn.
Alterations and repairs are another important way to keep clothes lasting longer and Jo readily offers this service.
