<h2>Design</h2>
<p>Jo has been designing and sketching garment ideas ever since she learnt to sew.  Jo loves creating unique clothes to reflect individual style and personality.
Jo’s strong belief in the importance of sustainability filters into her design process.  Sustainability could be in the choice of fabrics or in the actual design of the item itself.  She tries to create items that can be worn in different ways, or easily dressed up or down for different occasions.  
Please view the gallery for more examples of Jo’s creations.
